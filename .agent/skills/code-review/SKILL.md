# Code Review Skill
The code uses the architecture and principles outlined in docs/RAG_ARCHITECTURE.md.When reviewing code, follow these steps:

## Review checklist

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?

## How to provide feedback

- Be specific about what needs to change
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest alternatives when possible
- Create the code review report with a timestamp under docs/code-review/ directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
